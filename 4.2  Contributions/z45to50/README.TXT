I thought others might find the attached file useful.  It is an alternative to ZAF 
4.5's UI_WIN.HPP file.  It includes UI_WIN.HPP then defines ZAF 5.0 equivalents to 
ZAF 4.5 objects.  

I have a large project and I would like a little head start on translating it.  Now, 
I can include this file and start changing object names to the new names.

As I said, I think others might find it useful.  It is by no means all inclusive.
