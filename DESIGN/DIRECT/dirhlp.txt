Directory Service
The Directory Service allows you to access files on the current
system.\
\
To access an existing file, either enter the name in the FILENAME
field, or select it from the list below.\
\
Other files that belong to the current directory are listed in the
scrollable field below the FILENAME field.  Double clicking on a
name causes that file to be accessed immediately.\
\
The LIST FILES OF TYPE field determines the type of file, based on
the file extension, to list in the "Filename" field.  Selecting the " *.* "
extension causes all files in the current directory to be displayed.\
\
The current directory is shown below the DIRECTORIES prompt.  Your file
will be saved to this directory.  Since this item is not selectable, if
you want to make a different directory the current one, it must be done
by selecting a new directory from the list below the current directory prompt,
which displays other available directories of the current drive.\
\
The DRIVES field displays the current drive.  Selecting a drive causes
the files and directories on that drive to be displayed in their respective
fields.\
