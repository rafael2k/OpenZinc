About Help Editor
Zinc Help Editor allows you to interactively create help contexts
that can be associated in a language independent fashion within your
applications.  Simply create a help context and then select the
Context option to edit the help information for your application.\
\
After creating help contexts, you save them to disk in a
platform-independent persistent object file.  You then use these
contexts in your application with one line of code.  Help contexts
you create with the Windows version of Zinc Help Editor can be opened
and edited with any other platform version (such as DOS or OS/2) and vice versa.\

Help Context Creation
The context creation window allows you to create a new help context.\
\
Enter in the TITLE field the text that you would like to appear in the help window's title 
bar. \
\
The ID field is used to show the context number associated with with
the help item.  This value is set automatically by the help editor
when the help context is saved and therefore cannot be edited.\
\
Enter in the MESSAGE window the information that you would like to appear in the help 
window.\
\
Selecting the STORE button causes the current help context to be saved 
to the current file. If you have not entered a name for the help context 
through a Store As.. operation, you will be asked for a name before you can 
store the help context.\
\
The STORE AS button is generally used to store the current help context under 
another name.\
\
Selecting the CLOSE button causes the window to close without executing 
any changes.\
\
Additional information about creating help contexts appears when the
HELP button is selected.\
