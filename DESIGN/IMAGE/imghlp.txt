--- HELP_BITMAP_WINDOW
Bitmap Creation Window
The bitmap creation window is where you actually draw and set the size specifications
of bitmap images.\
\
The bitmap image is drawn in the creation window's drawing field, which is the large
square region in the upper left corner. You can paint
one pixel at a time by positioning on it and pressing a mouse button, or you can paint in
continuous motion by holding down a mouse button and dragging the
cursor.\
\
Different tools for drawing can be selected from the tool bar of the Image Editor control
window.  Simply select the desired tool.\
\
Colors are selected from the color palettes of the control window.  There are
three separate palettes--one for the left mouse button, one for the right mouse button, and
one for screen transparency.  The screen transparency palette is used when you want to
have part of your image show through to the screen behind it.  Whichever mouse button
is used to select a color from this palette then has the power to draw a transparent region. 
Thereafter, whenever a different color is selected from the screen palette, all of the
transparent region within the image will change to that color
instantly.\
\
As you create your image, it will be displayed in its actual size in the small square region,
called the image field, in the upper right corner of the window.\
\
The bitmap creation window also includes the following fields and
buttons:\
\
  Width-This field determines the pixel width of the bitmap image.  The default
width for a bitmap is 16 pixels.\
\
  Height-This field determines the pixel height of the bitmap image.  The
default height for a bitmap is 16 pixels.\
\
  Store-Selecting this button causes the current bitmap image to be saved in its
present condition to the current file.\
\
  Store As-This button is generally used to store the current bitmap image under
another name.\
\
  Close-Selecting this button causes the creation window to close without executing
any changes.\
\
  Help-Additional information about creating images appears when this button is
selected.\
\
  Size-Selecting this button causes the sizing information entered in the Width and
Height fields to take effect in the drawing field.\

--- HELP_MOUSE_WINDOW
Mouse Cursor Creation Window
The mouse cursor creation window is where you actually draw and set the size specifications
of mouse cursor images.\
\
The mouse cursor image is drawn in the creation window's drawing field, which is the large
square region in the upper left corner. You can paint
one pixel at a time by positioning on it and pressing a mouse button, or you can paint in
continuous motion by holding down a mouse button and dragging the

width for a mouse cursor is 16 pixels.\
\
  Height-This field determines the pixel height of the mouse cursor image.  The
default height for a mouse cursor is 16 pixels.\
\
  x-point-The value entered into this field determines the horizontal pixel coordinate
for the cursor's hot spot.\
\
  y-point-The value entered into this field determines the vertical pixel coordinate for
the cursor's hot spot.\
\
  Store-Selecting this button causes the current mouse cursor image to be saved in its

Bitmap Options
The Bitmap category options are used to create bitmap images. Options that are displayed in
the menu with `...' cause an associated window to appear when
selected. The following options are available:\
\
The Import option allows you to import images from another
.DAT file (Zinc), a .BMP file (MS Windows and OS/2), or an .XPM file
(OSF/Motif).\
\
The Export option allows you to export an image to another
file.\
\
The Create option allows you to create a bitmap image.\
\
The Load option is used to recall a previously created bitmap image from the current file.\
\
The Store option causes the current bitmap image to be saved in
its present condition.\
\
The Store As option allows you to save the current bitmap image
under another name.\
\
The Clear option causes the current bitmap creation window to be removed
from the screen.\
\
The Clear All option causes all bitmap creation windows present on the
screen to be removed.\
\
The Delete option allows you to delete a bitmap image from the
current file.\
\
--- HELP_OPT_EDIT
Edit Options
The Edit menu options allow you to edit images.  The following
options are available:\
\
The Grid option causes a grid coordinate system to be displayed in
the image creation field.  When this option is in effect, a check
mark is displayed next to it.\
\
The Roller Size option causes another menu to appear which lists roller size
choices.  The size of roller affects how wide the brush stroke is when using the roller
brush tool.  The choices range from 1 pixel by 1 pixel through
1 pixel by 5 pixels (1x1 to 1x5).\
\
Selecting the Pattern option allows you to choose what type of drawing tool or pattern
to use.  It causes another menu to appear with the following
options:\
\
  Pencil-This option sets the current drawing pen to the width of a pencil (one
pixel wide).\
\
  Roller-This option sets the current drawing device to be a roller brush.  In other
words, it has the capacity to draw with a width greater than one pixel at a time.  The
actual width is determined by Edit | Roller Size.\
\
  Line-This option allows you to draw a line.\
\
  Rectangle-This option allows you to create a hollow rectangle.\
\
  Fill Rectangle-This option allows you to create a filled rectangle.\
\
  Ellipse-This option allows you to create a hollow ellipse.\
\
  Fill Ellipse-This option allows you to create a filled ellipse.\
\
  Fill-This option allows you to perform a "flood fill" with the current drawing
color.\
\
The Erase option causes the current image to be erased from the image field.  It does
not delete the image from the file.\
\
The Cut option removes the current image group from the screen and places
it in a global paste buffer.  This option only has effect if a group is designated within the
image field.\
\
The Copy option copies the current image group and places the copy in a
global paste buffer.  This option only has effect if a group is designated within the image
field.\
\
The Paste option allows you to recall and position on the screen the contents of the
global paste buffer (placed there by Cut or Copy procedures).  After selecting Paste,
position the mouse cursor where you would like the paste to occur and press the left
mouse button.\
\
The Delete option causes the current image group to be cleared from the screen and
deleted from the file.  This option only has effect if a
group is designated within the image field.\
\
The Group option allows you to select a region on the image field to
become its own unit, or image group.  After selecting Group place the mouse cursor
at a corner of the region to be grouped and drag the mouse to the opposite corner. Upon releasing the
mouse, the region will be marked by a cyan border. Only one image group is permitted at a time.
Upon grouping a second region, the first
group in the same image will be dissolved (i.e., ungrouped).\
\
The Ungroup option causes the group within the current image field to be dissolved. 
In other words, the cyan border surrounding the group disappears, and the section once
again becomes a part of the original image.\
