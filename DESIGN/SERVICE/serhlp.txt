About Zinc Designer
Zinc Designer allows you to create and modify .DAT files.  .DAT files
can be used to load resource windows dynamically at run-time, to
store translations of text strings, to provide internationalization
data, to provide images for an application, or to store help information.
The Designer is divided into several components, each of which can be
used to work on specific information within the .DAT file.  These
components are:\
\
WINDOW EDITOR\
\
The Window Editor is used to create and modify resource windows.\
\
DEFAULTS EDITOR\
\
The Defaults Editor is used to create and modify tables of language
strings and locale formatting data used by Zinc.  This information is
accessed at run-time to produce localized applications.\
\
MESSAGE EDITOR\
\
The Message Editor is used to create and modify tables of messages which can be
loaded by your application at run-time and used wherever text strings are required.
\
IMAGE EDITOR\
\
The Image Editor provides options for creating icon, bitmap, and
mouse cursor images that can be used throughout your application.\
\
HELP EDITOR\
\
The Help Editor allows you to interactively create help contexts
that can be associated in a language independent fashion within your
applications.\
\
STRING EDITOR\
\
The String Editor allows you to use characters within your application 
which are not available from a standard keyboard. For example, if you need 
to translate your application into Chinese, the Chinese characters needed can 
be accessed from within the String Editor. Since this is accomplished using 
the complete Unicode character set, the String Editor is available only in 
Unicode mode. \
