Storage Service
The Storage Service allows you to access resources in the current
file.\
\
To access a resource, enter the name at the OBJECTNAME
prompt.\
\
Other resources that belong to the current directory are listed in the
scrollable field below the OBJECTNAME field. Selecting one of
these resources causes the name to appear in the OBJECTNAME field.\
\
The current directory is shown below the DIRECTORIES prompt.\
