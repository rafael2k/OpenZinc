String Editor Service
The String Editor allows you to use characters within your application 
which are not available from a standard keyboard. For example, if you need 
to translate your application into Chinese, or use extended Ascii
characters, the desired characters can be accessed from within the String
Editor.\
\
The String Editor can be invoked by either restoring it from its minimized icon on the 
bottom of the screen, or in DOS or Windows by pressing <F12> while positioned 
on any window field within Zinc Designer. The latter approach is most commonly
used when you are positioned in a field that you would like to translate.
Any editing done with the String Editor will be reflected in that field 
only.\
\
If you are not positioned in a window field containing text when you invoke 
the String Editor, any editing done can be transferred to a window field by 
by copying and pasting the string.\
\
The ORIGINAL field displays the text that is to be edited.\
\
The characters selected from the table appear in the CURRENT field, in the order that 
they are selected.\
\
The PAGE spin control field designates the currently displayed Unicode page. It 
actually displays the upper byte of the Unicode value, or the first two digits 
of the page number. To change pages, either enter the desired page number, 
or click on the spinner arrows to increment or decrement a page at a
time.\
\
The CHARACTER TABLE field displays the current page of the character table. To select
a character, click on it with the mouse and it will appear at the CURRENT prompt. 
Since not all characters can be rendered in all operating systems, some cells 
may be blank or display a filler character, depending on the system.\
