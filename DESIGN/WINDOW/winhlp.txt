\
--- HELP_UIW_SCROLL_BAR
Scroll Bar/Slider
A scroll bar is used to scroll the information contained within
another object, such as a list.  A horizontal scroll bar scrolls information
horizontally, a vertical scroll bar scrolls information vertically, and a
corner scroll box fills the area between the horizontal and vertical
scroll bars.\
\
A slider is typically used to visually indicate the current value
relative to the range of possible values and to allow the setting of a value.
It is different from a scroll bar, which is designed to scroll another 
object, such as a list.\
\
NOTE: A vertical slider's thumb button moves up as the 
slider's value increases, whereas a scroll bar's thumb button moves down as 
the scroll bar's value increases.\
\
The MINIMUM field specifies the minimum value of the scrolling
range.\
\
The MAXIMUM field specifies the maximum value of the scrolling range.\
\
The CURRENT field specifies the initial value of the scroll bar or
slider, or the initial position of its thumb button.\
\
Enter in the NAME field a name that will distinguish the scroll bar
or slider from other objects on the window.\
\
The HELP field designates the help context to be associated with the
scroll bar or slider.\
\
The options that determine the type of scroll bar/slider are listed
in the OPTIONS LIST on the right half of the window.  These options
are:\
\
  VERTICAL SLIDER/SCALE-Defines the object to be a vertical slider.\
\
  HORIZONTAL SLIDER/SCALE-Defines the object to be a horizontal
slider.\
\
  VERTICAL SCROLL BAR-Defines the object to be a vertical scroll
bar.\
\
  HORIZONTAL SCROLL BAR-Defines the object to be a horizontal scroll
bar.\
\
  CORNER SCROLL BOX-Defines the object to be a corner scroll box.\
\
--- HELP_UIW_SPIN_CONTROL
Spin Control
A spin control object is used to allow the user to select a value from a finite 
range of values.  The spin control can be used to set integer, real and bignum 
values, as well as times and dates.\
\
The TYPE field determines the type of object to be associated with the spin 
control.\
\
Selecting the EDIT... button brings up the information notebook for the type 
of object associated with the spin control, since that object is what 
determines the spin control's specifications.\
\
The DELTA field assigns the value by which the object value will be adjusted 
when the object is spun.  It should be specified in units appropriate to the 
object type.\
\
Enter in the NAME field a name that will distinguish the spin control from 
other objects on the window.\
\
The HELP field designates the help context to be associated with the spin 
control.\
\
--- HELP_UIW_STATUS_BAR
Status Bar
A status bar presents status information to the user.  It is not interactive,
but is a means of displaying information.  A status bar is like a modified window 
that always occupies the bottom width of the parent window.\
\
The HEIGHT field designates the height of the status bar within the
window.\
\
Enter in the NAME field a name that will distinguish the status bar from 
other objects on the window.\
\
The HELP field designates the help context to be associated with the status 
bar.\

value.\
\
  AUTOMATICALLY HIGHLIGHT DATA-Causes the string to be highlighted when 
the user tabs to the string field from another window field.\
\
--- HELP_UIW_SYSTEM_BUTTON
System Button
A system button is used to provide a small menu of standard, general
options that can be performed on a window.  Windows within the
Designer are automatically created with a system button, which is
displayed in the upper left corner.  The following options are
included by default in the button's related menu:\
\
  Restore-Restores the window from either a maximized or a minimized
state.\
\
  Move-Allows the window to be moved.\
\
  Size-Allows the window to be sized.\
\

in the parent window's information notebook, or editor.\
\
The NAME field displays the system button's name. This field is
nonselectable.\
\
--- HELP_UIW_TABLE
Table
A table object is used to create a table of records, which can be scrolled both 
vertically and horizontally. Records in the table can have one or more fields 
which may be of different types. One use of the table object would be a 
spreadsheet.\
\
A table object differs in one important way from the other objects of the 
Designer, in that it is merely a template for a table. The data for the fields in 
the table cannot be initialized from within the Designer; it must be set at run-
time. For example, though we may designate one cell of the table as a string 
field, we cannot specify the string's initial data from within the Designer. 
This is different from a horizontal list with a string field, which displays 
information that we assign to it.\
\
Enter in the NAME field a name that will distinguish the table object from 
other objects on the window.\
\
The HELP field designates the help context to be associated with the
table.\
\
The options that determine the presentation of the table are 
listed in the OPTIONS LIST on the right half of the window. The first section presents 
options that determine the support features of the table. These options
are:\
\
  VERTICAL SCROLL BAR-Places a vertical scroll bar inside the right border of 
the table.\
\
  HORIZONTAL SCROLL BAR-Places a horizontal scroll bar inside the bottom
border of the table.\
\
  COLUMN HEADING-Places a column header, with one prompt field attached 
to it, at the top of the table.\
\
  ROW HEADING-Places a row header, with one prompt field attached to it, at 
the left side of the table.\
\
The second section presents the following option:\
\
  DRAW GRID-Displays lines that divide the table's columns and rows.\
\
--- HELP_UIW_TABLE_HEADER
Table Header
Table headers provide information about the contents of the row or
column with which they are associated.  There are three types of
header:\
\
1) Corner Header\
A corner table header occupies the space between a column header and
a row header within a table.\
\
Enter in the NAME field a name that will distinguish the corner
header from other objects on the window.\
\
2) Column Header\
A column table header is used to display information about the data
presented in a table's column section.  Table records, which are
attached to the header, contain the actual label text.\
\
Enter in the NAME field a name that will distinguish the column
header from other objects on the window.\
\
3) Row Header\
A row table header is used to display information about the data
presented in a table's row section.  Table records, which are
attached to the header, contain the actual label text.\
\
Enter in the NAME field a name that will distinguish the row
header from other objects on the window.\
\
--- HELP_UIW_TABLE_RECORD
Table Record
A table record is the actual region to which specific fields are
attached, such as a string or date, within a table. Table records
are used in the headers to display information--typically labels that
identify the contents of the row or column--and in the table
directly, to display or collect data.\
\
Only one table record should be added to the table directly. The table
will use a virtual record to draw all the other displayed records, using
the data passed to the table at run-time.\
\
Enter in the NAME field a name that will distinguish the table record from 
other objects on the window.\
\
--- HELP_UIW_TEXT
Text
A text object is used to present and collect alphanumeric textual information 
in a multi-line format.\
\

object exactly as you want it to appear in your application.\
\
The number in the LENGTH field determines the number of characters that 
the text object will display.\
\
Enter in the NAME field a name that will distinguish the text object from 
other objects on the window.\
\
The HELP field designates the help context to be associated with the text 
object.\
\
The options that control the presentation of the text object are 
listed in the OPTIONS LIST on the right half of the window. The first section presents 
options for support features. The options are:\
\
  VERTICAL SCROLL-BAR-Adds a vertical scroll bar inside the right border of the 
text field.\
\
  HORIZONTAL SCROLL-BAR-Adds a horizontal scroll bar inside the bottom border
of the text field.\
\
The second section of the list presents options for formatting input. The 
options are:\
\
  DON'T WRAP TEXT IN FIELD-Disables the default word wrap in the text
field.\
\
  AUTOMATICALLY HIGHLIGHT DATA-Causes the current text value to be highlighted 
when the user tabs to the field from another window field.\
\
--- HELP_UIW_TIME
Time
A time field displays and collects time information.\
\
Enter in the VALUE field the time that you want to appear in the time
object.\
\
If you want to specify a certain range of acceptable time values, enter 
in the RANGE field the valid time ranges.\
\
Enter in the NAME field a name that will distinguish the time object from 
other objects on the window.\
\
The HELP field designates the help context to be associated with the time 
object.\
\
The options that control the presentation of the time object are 
listed in the OPTIONS LIST on the right half of the window. The first section presents 
options for display format. The options are:\
\
  INCLUDE HUNDREDTHS-Includes the hundredths value in the time.\
\
  INCLUDE SECONDS-Includes the seconds value in the time.\

  12 HOUR-Forces the time to be displayed and interpreted using a 12-hour 
clock, regardless of the default country information.\
\
--- HELP_UIW_TITLE
Title
A title bar is used to display the title for a window and to allow
for moving the window with the mouse. A window can also be maximized
by double-clicking on the title with the mouse, or if the window is
already maximized, the window can be restored to its original size by
double-clicking on it. Windows within the
Designer are automatically created with a title bar, which is
displayed across the top of the window.\
\
Enter in the TITLE field the text to be displayed as the title within
the title bar.\
\
The NAME field displays the title bar's name. This field is
nonselectable.\
\
--- HELP_UIW_TOOL_BAR
Tool Bar
A tool bar is used as a controlling structure for a set of selectable window objects.  It
differs from the pull-down menu in that a variety of objects can be added to
it-not just string items.  The tool bar will automatically occupy the upper-most area available in a
window, positioning itself directly below the pull-down menu, if one exists.  Multiple tool
bars may be added to a window.\
\
An object can be added to the tool bar by selecting the desired object from the control
window's menu or object bar and placing it on the resource window's tool bar.  The
control window's object bar itself is an example of a group of bitmapped buttons that
have been attached to a tool bar.\
\
Enter in the NAME field a name that will distinguish the tool bar from other
objects.\
\
The HELP field designates the help context to be associated with the tool bar. 
\
The options that control interaction with the tool bar are listed in the
OPTIONS LIST on the right half of the window.  The options are:\
\
  BITMAP CHILDREN-Indicates that some of the objects contain bitmaps. This flag
should be set when adding check boxes or radio buttons to the vertical
list.\
\
  SELECT MULTIPLE OBJECTS-Allows more than one object to be selected at a time. 
This option must be set if check boxes are added to the tool bar.\
\
  DON'T WRAP KEYSTROKES-Causes objects placed in the tool bar to be positioned
according to their specified coordinates.\
\
--- HELP_UIW_VT_LIST
Vertical List
A vertical list is used to display items in a single-column fashion.  The list is only
scrollable vertically.\
\
If you want to have a compare function associated with the list, you can
enter the name of it in the COMPARE field.  The function must be defined somewhere in your
code under the same name that is entered so that Zinc Designer can find it and
execute the designated action.\
\
Enter in the NAME field a name that will distinguish the vertical list object from
other objects.\
\
The HELP field designates the help context to be associated with the vertical
list.\
\
The options that control the presentation and operation of the vertical
list are listed in the OPTIONS LIST on the right half of the window.  The first section presents
the following support feature option:\
\
  VERTICAL SCROLL BAR-Causes a vertical scroll bar to be added to the
list.\
\
The second section presents options that determine interaction with the list.  The
options are:\
\
  ALPHABETICAL SORTING-Causes the options to be sorted in alphabetical
order.\
\
  BITMAP CHILDREN-Indicates that some of the objects contain bitmaps. This flag
should be set when adding check boxes or radio buttons to the vertical
list.\
\
  DON'T WRAP KEYSTROKES-Will not allow arrowing up, down, left or right to wrap
from the end of the list to the beginning or vice versa.\
\
  SELECT ON DOWN CLICK-Selects the item on a button down-click, rather than on a
down-click and release action.\
\
  CONTINUE SELECTION ON DRAG-Allows the end-user to drag through the list options
with the mouse button pressed.  If this flag is not set, the
highlight on the list items will not follow the dragging mouse.\
\
  SELECT MULTIPLE ITEMS-Allows more than one object to be selected at a
time.\
\
--- HELP_UIW_WINDOW
Window
A window is used as a controlling structure for displaying and interacting with other
objects.  Objects can be added by simply selecting them from the menu
or object bar and placing them on the window.\
\
Enter in the TITLE field text exactly as you want it to appear in the window's title. 
It will be automatically centered vertically.\
\
The MINICON field designates the bitmap image to be associated with the window
when it is minimized.\
\
Enter in the NAME field a name that will distinguish the window from other
objects.\
\
The HELP field designates the help context to be associated with the window.\
\
The options that control the presentation and operation of the window are
listed in the OPTIONS LIST on the right half of the window.  The first section presents options
that determine the support features of the window.  These options
are:\
\
  BORDER-Draws a three-dimensional border around the outer perimeter of the
window.\
\
  MAXIMIZE BUTTON-Attaches a maximize button to the window that will enlarge
the window to its maximum size on the screen when selected.\
\

window to its minimum size on the screen when selected.\
\
  SYSTEM BUTTON-Attaches a system button to the window.\
\
  GEOMETRY MANAGEMENT-Enables the geometry management feature for the window,
meaning that objects which are attached to the window can then be
positioned and sized according to their own geometry management specifications. 
If this option has not been previously set and one of the child objects is using
geometry management, it will automatically be toggled.\
\
  VERTICAL SCROLL BAR-Places a vertical scroll bar inside the right border of the
child window.\
\
  HORIZONTAL SCROLL BAR-Places a horizontal scroll bar inside the bottom border
of the child window.\
\
The second section presents options that determine the window's type.  The options
are:\
\
  DEFAULT-Creates a normal window.\
\
  DIALOG OBJECT-Creates the window as a dialog box.  A dialog box is a
temporary window used to display or receive information from the user.  Using
this flag will cause a dialog style border to be displayed.\
\
  MDI OBJECT-Creates the window as an MDI window.  An MDI parent must
have a pull-down menu.  In general, other than the standard support objects (i.e.,
system button, border, title, etc.) and the pull-down menu, MDI parent windows
should only contain MDI children.\
\
The third section presents options that determine interaction with the window. 
The options are:\
\
  ALPHABETICAL SORTING-Causes the objects to be sorted and displayed in
alphabetical order on the window.\
\
  SELECT MULTIPLE OBJECTS-Allows more than one object to be selected at a
time.\
\
  SELECT ON DRAG OPERATION-Causes any objects overlapped by a drag operation to

\
--- HELP_UI_ADVANCED
Advanced Page
The Advanced notebook page contains information relating to the advanced 
properties of an object. It is designed for use by the experienced user
only.\
\
The NUMBERID field assigns a unique programmer number to the object. By 
default this number corresponds to the order in which the object was created 
in the program.\
\
If you want to have a CALLBACK function, or user function, associated with the
object, you can enter the function's name in this field.  When using a callback
function, the function itself must be defined somewhere in your code with the
same name that is entered in the information notebook.\
\
The USEROBJECT field designates a void pointer to a user-specified
object.\
\
The USERFLAGS field contains any flags that are set and maintained by the 
programmer.\
\
The USERSTATUS field contains any status flags that are set and maintained 
by the programmer.\
\
The DERIVED NAME field contains the name of the derived class to inherit 
the properties of the current object.  As part of the code for the derived class, 
the programmer must create a static New function that is able to call the 
constructor for the derived class.\
\
The OPTIONS LIST is located on the right side of the Advanced page, and 
it displays options which control the advanced properties and operations of 
the current object. Options that are not applicable to the current object are
grayed out, meaning that they cannot be selected.\
\
The first section of the list presents options that determine the extent to 
which the end user can interact with or edit the object. Only one of these can 
be current at a time. The options are:\
\
  NORMAL INTERACTION-Allows the end user to have normal interaction with 
the object, including being able to select, position on and edit it (if it is an 
editable object).\
\
  VIEW ONLY-Prevents the object from being edited.\
\
  NON-CURRENT-The object cannot be made current.\
\
  NON-SELECTABLE (GRAY)-Prevents the object from being selected. The
object will be displayed in a dimmed (usually gray) color to suggest
that it is non-selectable.\
\
  NON-SELECTABLE (BLACK)-Prevents the object from being selected. The
object will still be displayed in a dark (usually black) color,
however.\
\
The second section of the list presents options that determine the initial
settings of the object. The options are:\
\
  MARK AS INVALID-Sets the initial status of the object to be
invalid.\
\
  MARK AS UNANSWERED-Sets the initial status of the field to be
unanswered.\
\
The third section of the list presents options that determine other default
settings for the object. The options are:\
\
  DON'T DEALLOCATE DATA-Causes the object to not allocate its own buffer for 
data. If this option is set, you must allocate a buffer that will be used to 
store the object's data.\
\
  ALLOW MOVE DRAGGING-Allows the object to be moved in a drag and 
drop operation.\
\
  ALLOW COPY DRAGGING-Allows the object to be copied in a drag and 
drop operation.\
\
  ALLOW OBJECT DROPPING-Allows objects to be dropped onto the current 
object in a drag and drop operation.\
\
  SUPPORT OBJECT-Causes the object to be placed in the parent object's support
list.\
\
--- HELP_UI_GENERAL
General Page
The General notebook page contains information related to 
the specific object being edited. It is always the first page visible upon
entering the information notebook. Since each object is different, the editable 
properties will vary, but the following fields are common to most
objects:\
\
The TEXT or VALUE field allows you to enter information to be displayed 
within the object exactly as you want it to appear in your
application.\
\
Some objects allow a COMPARE function, which is typically used to 
sort information. If you want to have a compare function associated with the 
object, you can enter the function's name in this field.  When using a compare
function, the function itself must be defined somewhere in your code with the
same name that is entered in the information notebook.\
\
The NAME field contains the name (sometimes called a string identification) 
for the object and is present in every object information notebook. Because
these objects appear in various lists throughout the program, it is 
recommended that you override the default name and enter a string that more 
specifically identifies the object.\
\
The HELP field designates the help context to be associated with the
object.\
\
The OPTIONS LIST is located on the right side of the General page. It displays
options which control the general presentation and operation of the 
object.\
\
--- HELP_UI_GEOMETRY_MANAGER
Geometry
The geometry object is used to manage constraints within a window.\
\
Enter in the TEXT field text exactly as you want it to appear in the
geometry object.\
\
  The CONSTRAINTS field displays the window constraints, listed in the order in which they were
created, that are attached to the window.
\
--- HELP_UI_OBJECT
Subobjects Page
The Subobjects page allows you to modify the subobjects of the
current object.  It contains the following fields:\
\
  The OBJECTS field displays the objects, listed in the order in which they were
created, that are attached to the current object.  The editor of any one of these objects can
be accessed by one of the following methods: double click on the desired object with
a mouse, scroll to it and press <space>, or click on the EDIT button while it is
highlighted in the list.\
\
  The DIRECTORIES field displays the other objects--both parent and
subobjects--that
are related to the current object.  Double clicking on one of the names (or hitting
<Enter> while the name is current) causes the ``Objects'' field to display the
subobjects of the selected object.  This feature allows you to move within an extensive
hierarchy--such as a pull-down menu--without having to interact with every level
of it.\
\
  Selecting the EDIT button causes the editor of the object highlighted in the
OBJECTS list to appear.\
\
  Selecting the ADD button causes the object appearing in the combo box (located in
the lower right corner of the page) to be added to the current
object.\
\
  Selecting the DELETE button causes the highlighted object in the
OBJECTS list to be deleted.  (<Ctrl Delete> also performs this
action.)\
\
  Selecting the MOVE UP button causes the highlighted object in the
OBJECTS list to move up one line in the list. <Ctrl up-arrow> also performs this action.)  Moving an
object changes the tab order of objects on the screen.  For list item objects, such as
pop-up items, it also changes the order that the items appear within the parent
lists.\
\
  Selecting the MOVE DOWN button causes the highlighted object in the
OBJECTS list to move down one line in the list. (<Ctrl down-arrow> also performs this action.)  Moving
an object changes the tab order of objects on the screen.  For list item objects, such
as pop-up items, it also changes the order that the items appear within the parent
lists.\
\
  The ADD OBJECT COMBO BOX designates the type of object to be added when
the ADD button (described above) is selected.  Select the combo box button to
view a list of the available objects.  If you select one of the objects listed, it will be
added to the current parent object whenever the ADD button is
selected.\
\
--- HELP_UI_POSITION
Position Page
The Position notebook page contains information related to an object's
position, border, region, and alignment.  The fields of the Position page
are the same for every object. They are as follows:\
\
The POSITION/SIZE field allows you to alter the positioning and size of the 
object. The first row within the field contains three buttons that 
determine the coordinate scale to be used.  Depressing the left button
causes screen coordinates to be based on a pixel scale.  Depressing the
middle button causes screen coordinates to be based on a mini-cell scale,
which is 1/10 of a cell coordinate by default.  Depressing the right button
causes screen coordinates to be based on a whole cell scale.\
\
Underneath each button in the POSITION/SIZE field is a column of fields that 
display the precise location and size of the object.  Only the column 
underneath the currently selected option is selectable and editable.\
\
The top two fields of each column, COLUMN and LINE, determine the object's 
location.  The lower two fields, WIDTH and HEIGHT, determine the object's size.\
\
The two buttons contained in the BORDER field determine whether or not the 
object is displayed with a border.\
\
The two buttons contained in the REGION field determine the region allocated
for the object.\
\
The three buttons contained in the ALIGNMENT field determine the alignment 
of the text within the object. Depressing the left button causes the text to be 
justified to the left margin, depressing the middle button causes the text to be 
centered, and depressing the right button causes the text to be justified to the 
right margin.\
\
--- HELP_ZAF_DERIVED_OBJECT
Derived Object
The derived object lets you place an object that will be of your own
derived type in a window.  Within the Designer, the object is
essentially a place holder, since the Designer doesn't know about
your derived class.\
\
Your source code must provide a class by the same name as what you
specified in the Advanced page of the derived object's information
notebook.  This class must have a static New() function, and a static 
ZIL_ICHAR array called _className.  The New() function must conform
to the specification described in the Programmer's Reference manual
(see any window object's chapter or the UI_WINDOW_OBJECT chapter). 
_className can be any string you desire.\
\
Enter in the NAME field a name that will distinguish the derived
window object from other objects on the window.\
\
The HELP field designates the help context to be associated with the
derived window object.\
\
--- HELP_ZAF_EDIT_GROUP
Edit Group
An edit group allows you to select a region of objects to be combined into 
one unit.  Only one edit group is permitted per window at one time. Upon
grouping a second region, the first group in the same window will be
ungrouped.\
\
The options that determine the item's features are listed in the 
OPTIONS LIST on the right half of the window. The options in the
first section determine the objects' justification:\
\
  NONE-Leaves the objects where they are.\
\
  LEFT-Causes all of the objects within the group to be displayed 
next to the left border of the gray area.\
\
  CENTER-Causes all of the objects within the group to be displayed
in the horizontal center of the gray area.\
\
  RIGHT-Causes all of the objects within the group to be displayed
next to the right border of the gray area.\
\
The second section affects the objects' tab order.  The option in
this section is:\
\
  ON SCREEN LOCATION-Causes the objects within the group to be 
sorted in top-left to bottom-right priority.\
\
--- HELP_ZAF_GEOMETRY_MANAGER
Geometry Page
The Geometry notebook page allows you to place constraints on an object 
that specify how the object should be sized and positioned under specific 
conditions.  For example, using geometry management, you can determine 
how an object will react to re-sizing of its parent object--whether it stays at 
a fixed location or moves relative to the parent, whether it stays the same 
size or grows with the parent, etc.\
\
Geometry management also allows you to establish a connection
relationship between two child objects and to set size constraints for
individual objects.\
\
The fields of the Geometry page are the same for every object. They are as 
follows:\
\
The ATTACHMENT GROUP, located on the left side of the page, is designed 
to visually represent the relationship between the current object and its
surroundings.  The small square in the center represents the object itself,
and the four lines, one radiating from each side of the square, represent possible
connections to the surrounding objects. Each line ends at a combo box field 
which displays the type of connection for that line.\
\
To change the type of connection, select the combo box button and a list of 
available types will be displayed. The following three types are
available:\
\
  NONE-Indicates that no connection is in effect.\
\
  RELATIVE-Causes the object's border to position itself within its parent
relative to the parent's borders. In this case, the value entered into the offset 
field will represent a percentage ratio for placement.  NOTE: A relative connection
is possible only between a child object and its parent-not between two child window
objects.\
\
  ABSOLUTE-Causes the object's border to position itself relative to its parent 
or sibling object at a fixed distance. In this case, the value entered into 
the offset field will represent a fixed measurement for placement.\
\
The CONSTRAINT FEATURES group determines the constraint features of the 
connection in the attachment group currently being edited. It contains the 
following fields:\
\
  OFFSET-Determines the offset of the current connection, or the amount of 
space between its inside and outside anchors. The actual measurement of 
the value depends upon whether the connection is relative, in which case 
the value represents a percentage ratio, or absolute, in which case the 
value represents a fixed measurement.\
\
  OPTIONS-Presents several options that alter the typical behavior of the 
connections. The following options are available:\
\
  STRETCH-Causes the actual object to stretch or shrink as the anchor border 
is moved.\
\
  OPPOSITE-Causes the connection to be anchored to the opposite border of 
the object designated in CONNECT.\
\
  HZ-CENTER-Causes the connection to be anchored from the horizontal 
center of the current object. This allows for more consistent placement, 
especially when centering the object.\
\
  VT-CENTER-Causes the connection to be anchored from the vertical center 
of the current object. This allows for more consistent placement, especially
when centering the object.\
\
  ANCHOR-This field determines what the current connection is anchored
to.\
\
The SIZE RESTRICTIONS field determines the minimum and maximum size for 
the object. The first row determines the range of WIDTH values, while the
second row determines the range of HEIGHT values. The first value of each row 
represents the minimum size possible, and the second the maximum
possible.\
\
--- HELP_ZAF_WINDOW_EDITOR
Window Editor
The Window Editor controls the creation of windows and the objects on
them.  It has the following fields:\
\
The TITLE BAR identifies which Designer is in use, the ISO
designer or the Unicode Designer, as well as the name of the .DAT
file being edited.\
\
The PULL-DOWN MENU provides access to all the operations that can be
performed from the control window.  It has the following options:\
\
  File-File category options control the general operations of Zinc Designer
files.  Options that are displayed in the menu with `...' cause an associated
window to appear when selected.\
\
  Edit-Edit category options are used to edit the appearance and performance
of objects within the current file.  Options that are displayed in
the menu with `...' cause an associated window to appear when
selected.\
\
  Window-The Window category options allow you to create, modify and retrieve
window resources in the current file.  Options that are displayed in
the menu with `...' cause an associated window to appear when
selected.\
\
  Object-The Object category provides options that allow you to actually create
objects. Each of the options on this menu is a category under which
several window objects are classified.  Selecting one of the options causes
another associated menu to appear, which lists the actual window objects of
that category.\
\
  Help-The Help category provides help on specific topics related to
the Window Editor.\
\
The BUTTON BAR (not present in text mode) provides quick access to
each of the window objects that can be placed on a window.\
\
The STATUS BAR provides feedback on the current object being edited. 
It has the following fields:\
\
  Type-Indicates the type of object being edited.\
\
  Name-Indicates the name of the object being edited.\
\
  Pos-Indicates the starting position of the object being edited.
\
  Size-Indicates the size of the object being edited.\
\
  Place Object-Indicates the type of object which has been selected
for placement on another object.\
\
--- HELP_ZAF_WINDOW_PREFERENCES
Preferences Help
The Preferences option allows you to change the default settings of Zinc Designer. 
These settings are saved in the ZINC.CFG file.\
\
The DELTA STORAGE group gives you access to delta storage, which allows you to save only the changes
of the current file to another file. The group contains the following
fields:\
\
  CURRENT displays the path name of the delta file.  This field is not
editable.\
\
  PATHNAME designates the name for the delta copy file.\
\
  EXTENSION designates the subdirectory where the delta object will
be stored.\
\
  Selecting the START button causes the designated delta file to be opened.  Any modifications
made to the current file thereafter will be saved to the
delta file only. Selecting the END button causes the delta file designated at the ``Pathname'' prompt
to be closed. The START and END buttons work independently of the three main buttons of the
Window Editor Preferences window. While you are in delta mode (i.e., you have
opened a delta file and not closed it yet), a "(D)" appears on the control
window's title bar, to the right of the file name.\
\
The MINICELL field allows you to set the default coordinate minicell ratios.  The default width and
height are 1/10.\
\
The FILE OPTIONS group contains options for file backups, file extensions, and what files to save.
Enter in the BACKUPS field the number of backups that you would like the designer
to maintain.  Each backup file will be saved under the same name as the main file
but with an extension that indicates the backup number of the copy.
If any number greater than "1" is entered at the prompt, each time a save 
occurs another backup file will be created, up to the maximum specified.
The Designer will create up to nine backups.\
\
Enter in the DEFAULT EXTENSION field the default extension for files saved in the
designer.  Zinc's default is .dat, but you can enter a different default for your
applications, if desired.\
\
Select the WRITE HPP and/or the WRITE CPP option if you want an .HPP file
or .CPP file to be generated with each save operation.  When these options are not in effect, save operations will be much
quicker.\
