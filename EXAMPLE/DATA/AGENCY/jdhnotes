agency is altered for linux because ownerdraw items in a list have spacing problems.
To remedy this;
1. proportial fonts (Large and small) courier have been added
2. the buttons native DrawItem() function is used. Merely the title is manipulated

Note: in UIW_BUTTON's DrawItem() function justification controls the location of
any bitmap. if left justified bitmap appears on left, if right justified appears on 
right, if center justified bitmap appears in center on a line above the text.
