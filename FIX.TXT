Welcome to Zinc Application Framework 4.2!  This file contains
information about items that have been fixed or changed in Zinc 4.2.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

Fix: 3-D Controls now work in Windows, Windows NT, Windows 95 and
Win32s regardless of which versions of ctl3dv2.dll and ctl3d32.dll
are installed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Fix: If a derived object has been stored to a .DAT file, and the .DAT
file is later opened, other objects of the same type can now be given
the same derived name.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Fix: Macintosh Zinc applications used to randomly lock up when switching
between applications.  This was due to a problem in the Macintosh
API.  This has been worked around. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Fix: Geometry management previously didn't work in groups on Windows
95. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Fix: In Windows the first table record of a table is now initialized
with meaningful data.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Fix: Text objects larger than 256 bytes used to cause a GPF in
Windows.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Fix: Pop up menus no longer lock up the application in Windows if
they are added directly to the window manager.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Change: Removed field validation forcing an invalid field to remain
current.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Fix: In OS/2 icons used to display incorrectly if the screen
resolution was greater than 800 x 600.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Fix: In Motif Non-selectable buttons used to change the display to
draw stippled and not restore the correct drawing style.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Fix: The L_VIEW message now moves through the system correctly on the
Macintosh.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Fix: The L_CONTINUE_SELECT message is now handled correctly on the
Macintosh.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Fix: Drag and Drop now works correctly for MDI applications on the
Macintosh.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Fix: The table object now scrolls by records instead of by pixels on
the Macintosh if the record's height is less than the height of the
client region for the table.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Fix: Clicking on the last record in a table used to not select that
item.  It would instead scroll to the top of the table in Windows,
and on the Macintosh.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Change: Support has been added for the Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0 and
the Borland 5.0 compilers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Fix: Added the capability for an item in a vertical list to be
shorter than a cellheight for Windows 95.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Change: It is now possible to compile the DOS library for Borland
without having to have TASM.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Fix: In Windows Notebooks used to beep when a hotkey was pressed that
was associated with one of the notebook tabs that was used.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Fix: Windows used to activate the current item of a group that was
scrolled into view.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Fix: Removed a memory leak in Motif associated with font tables. 
This requires an updated ZincApp file (included with this distribution)
to take advantage of the fix.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Fix: Cleared the highlight from an editable field when it loses
focus.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Change: Brought the INSTALL script up to date with Zinc 4.2.
