This file describes how to use Borland's 16 and 32 bit PowerPak
DOS extenders with Zinc Application Framework 4.2.

1) Update your path environment variable.  The Borland
BGI directory must be in your path (C:\BC4\BGI).

2) For PowerPak 16, update your Borland TURBOC.CFG and
TLINK.CFG files and set up the Zinc include and library paths.
For PowerPack 32, update the BCC32.CFG and TLINK32.CFG files.

3) Build the PowerPak 16 libraries by using one of these
command lines from the \ZINC\SOURCE directory:

    make -fbtcpp450.mak dos16
    make -fbtcpp500.mak dos16

4) Build the PowerPak 32 libraries by using one of these
command lines from the \ZINC\SOURCE directory:

    make -fbtcpp450.mak dos32
    make -fbtcpp500.mak dos32

5) You can do similar to the above when using BTCPP400.MAK
or BTCPP450.MAK to build Zinc example and tutorial programs.


*** NOTES ***

- POWERPACK 16-bit has problems switching between multiple fonts.
  The Zinc BGI display class registers and uses 3 Zinc-created fonts.
  However, the BGI library in 16-bit PowerPack discards these fonts
  when another font is used.  The BGI library instead tries to read
  one of its own fonts from disk.

  You need to rename the Zinc BGI font files to the filenames
  that BGI tries to load and place them in the BGI driver's directory.
  BGI looks for the font files in the same directory where it found the
  display driver.  This means that in addition to the BGI files you
  would normally ship with your executable (e.g., EGAVGA.BGX, etc.) you
  will need to ship the Zinc font files.  The font files, which are
  located in the ZINC\SOURCE\BGI directory, should be copied to the
  BGI driver's directory and renamed as follows:

        ???_SMAL.CHR ==> LITT.CHR
        ???_DIAL.CHR ==> TRIP.CHR
        ???_SYST.CHR ==> SANS.CHR

  ??? indicates either ISO or OEM, whichever fonts your application
  uses.

  Because these font files have the same names as Borland fonts, you
  will not be able to use the Borland fonts in your Zinc application.

- POWERPACK 32-bit has a bug in the BGI32.DLL that causes
  mouse trails to appear when xor mode is used for drawing.  Borland
  has released a patched BGI32.DLL that fixes this problem.  We ship
  it in the ZINC\POWERPAK directory.

- No GFX support--only BGI.
