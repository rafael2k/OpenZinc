Included in this directory are upgraded fonts for use with Zinc
Application Framework 4.0 and the UI_BGI_DISPLAY class.  These are
stroked fonts that have been created by Zinc Software Incorporated.
This version includes the European extended ASCII character set (code
page 437 only) and have been tested with Zinc Application Framework 
4.0.  These fonts are included in DOS_BGI.LIB

You can use the Borland font editor FE.EXE (available on CompuServe 
or from Borland) to edit the fonts.  Be aware, however, that some 
versions of the font editor do NOT work correctly.  To avoid 
problems, rename DIALOG.CHR to TRIP.CHR, SYSTEM.CHR to SANS.CHR, and 
SMALL.CHR to LITT.CHR while editing and then rename them back.  Also, 
sometimes the font editor may move the font position down slightly.  
This can be corrected by sizing character the "E with a hat"
character to a smaller size.

To convert the CHR files to OBJ files use the following lines:
    bgiobj /f system.chr system.obj _SystemFont
    bgiobj /f dialog.chr dialog.obj _DialogFont
    bgiobj /f small.chr small.obj _SmallFont

If you have any questions or problems with the fonts please contact
Zinc Technical Support at (801) 785-8998 or leave a message on the
BBS at (801) 785-8997.
