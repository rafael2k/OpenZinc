Notes for gcc preproccessor

In files loc2dat.cpp, lang2dat.cpp and map2dat.cpp the line

#define FILENAME(x)	append(lang_, x, .cpp)

needs to be changed to 

#define FILENAME(x)	append(lang_, x,.cpp)

to eliminate the blanks space in the pasted token. The preprocessor 
will still issue a warning that  pasting "xxxx" and "." does not give a valid preprocessing token but the file will be included and the object file will be created.


In file lang2dat.cpp the following change was also made

//	for (int len=0; defaultLanguage[len].text; len++)
//		;
//two lines above changed to three lines below to meet current
//scoping rules for for
	int len;
	for (len=0; defaultLanguage[len].text; len++)
		;
