Borlandc 3.1 apparently runs out of memory when compiling the entire OpenZinc library 
in one go (at least from the command line in Windows 7).
So the library has been split in two to allow compilation without complaint. 
These libraries have been named dos_zil.lib and dos_zil2.lib in DOS 
and win_zil.lib and win_zil2.lib under 16 bit windows. 
Dos_zilo.lib is small enough it does not need to be split.
