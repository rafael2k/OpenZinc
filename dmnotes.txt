Dmc is the more current name for the sc compiler.
The compiling environment is controlled by the sc.ini file much like the turboc.cfg and tlink.cfg files.
To use the X32 dos extender copy the x32 lib files to the DM\lib directory.the compiler switch

NOTE:The compiler switch -bx must be removed from makefiles(DOS & win16) or an obsolete compiler will be called

In file gfx.h xor is used as an identifier, replaced by xorInt

In file Z_DSP.CPP in constructor the lines

        void z_gen_dummy(void);
        z_gen_dummy();
        extern void z_dsp_dummy(void);
        z_dsp_dummy();

cause the linker to complain for winnt and windows so I simply did

#if !defined(__SC__)
        void z_gen_dummy(void);
        z_gen_dummy();
        extern void z_dsp_dummy(void);
        z_dsp_dummy();
#endif

and it works OK

In dm.mak for the library use rc only with the test.rc file for windows compilaton

For 32 bit dos compilation the x32.lib needs to be explicitly added to the

D32_LIBS=d32_zil d32_gfx dm_32gfx x32

line

I have added a section to the makefile to allow for making a win32 version of the
lib under win32. (Pretty basic need). To do so needed to:
1. create a win32 section in the dm.mak file
2. Add -DZIL_WIN32 to the W32_CPP_OPTS= parameter. There is no obvious easy way
        to use predefined       macros to do this.
3. created a w32_zil.rsp file to make the library

Program nvlist.exe and 9vlist.exe in the tutor directory need work

------ DESIGNER --------------------------------------------------

There is a name conflict in making the designer under winnt and win32.
Digital Mars uses the symbol DECIMAL in headers for winnt and win32.
In file p_i18n.dat in both windows LOC_CURRENCY and LOC_NUMBER there is a field 
named DECIMAL. This causes a conflict when compiled. Therefore, the name of
the field in each window has been changed to DECIMAL_SYMBOL. This in turn
changes the name in the generated file p_i18n.hpp. Finally, the symbol 
DECIMAL must be changed to DECIMAL_SYMBOL in files Z_CURR.CPP and Z_NUM.CPP to 
allow linking.
