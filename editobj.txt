What's probably going on is if you have done a DataSet with only a
pointerto the new text, not including the size in the call to DataSet,
then the maxlength
is probably set to the length of the text that was set.
 
You should be able to verify this by calling DataSet with two
parameters, text
and lenght:
 
        string->DataSet(newText, LONG_LENGTH);
 
The function is located in Z_STRING.CPP for the UIW_STRING and
Z_TEXT.CPP for the UIW_TEXT.
 
 
If you are on CAP (I can't verify that here) then please note the
signature
below.
