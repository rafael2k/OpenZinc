This file describes the current support in Zinc Application Framework
4.2 for internationalized applications and briefly describes on-going
development.  The details of future work may change; the information
here is for use only as a guideline.

Zinc has standardized on the ISO 8859-1 character set because it was 
an international and a multiplatform standard, and because of its 
relation to the Unicode two-byte standard.  Using the ISO set allows 
Zinc to create programs and data files that are portable across  
supported platforms and to future versions of ZAF.

    DOS TEXT: We can remap most codepages.  Codepage 850 should be
        used for full ISO support.

    DOS GFX: We provide both ISO (default) and codepage 437 fonts.

    DOS BGI: We provide both ISO (default) and codepage 437 fonts.

    DOS MSC: We use HELVB.FON, which is actually a codepage 850
        font. Then remap the characters to the proper positions.
        (This is what Microsoft does with Windows.)

    DOS FG: We provide an 850 font and remap it.

    MS-WINDOWS/NT: Codepage 1250 is ISO-compatible.

    OS/2: See DOS TEXT.

    Motif: The default fonts are ISO-compatible.

You can load other fonts, on those platforms that support it, and you
can remove the mapping function (by a flag in the ui_env.hpp).  Unless 
there is some compelling reason for this, we suggest you use the ISO 
character mappings both to remain compatible with future versions and 
to allow the easiest internationalization of your application.

Follow these instructions to input ISO characters on various platforms
in a Zinc application:

    DOS Text: Load any codepage (and any local keyboard
        driver) and type the character, or use ALT-nnn where nnn is
        the loaded codepage value.  All are mapped to their ISO value.

    DOS Graphics: The fonts must use the ISO 8859-1 character
        mapping.  (Fonts included with Zinc follow this standard.)
        You may load any local keyboard driver and type the character,
        or use Alt-nnn where nnn is loaded code page value.

    MS-WINDOWS/NT: Type the character on the keyboard or use the
        ALT-nnn where nnn is the codepage value or ALT-0nnn
        where nnn is the ISO value.  Both become ISO values.

    Motif: Hold the ALT or Extended char key down and type a key.

The following languages use the ISO 8859-1 character set:

        Danish
        Dutch
        English
        Faroese
        Finnish
        French
        German
        Icelandic
        Irish
        Italian
        Norwegian
        Portuguese
        Spanish
        Swedish

The semantics of these characters follows the Unicode standard in that the
the diacritical marks are spacing marks, not overstrikes.  Other ISO
character sets (-2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8 and -9) aren't supported.
Use the Unicode key instead.

Line-drawing and special graphics (0x00-0x1f and 0x80-0x9f) characters
are mapped only in the MS-DOS environment, not anywhere else.  They are
mapped so that DOS TEXT mode can work properly.  Your program may not be
portable to any other platform if you use these characters.
