1. a DOS only version that is minimal in size and decent looking
	The visual basic style text interface is BAD not needed
	The shadow style and standard interfaces are not real good either but fairly functional
	None of these options are particularly good
	Other possible options include using Zinc interface as a wrapper around either TurboVision or Mix window toolkit
	or to make the interface more attractive.
	TurboVision would be interesting as a C++ framework within C++ framework example looking for a thin layer. 
	Mix Window toolkit would be less redundant.
	This is an interesting but low priority item 
	Note 8/19/10 Merely altering the palettes for text displays as contained in g_pnorm.cpp massively
	improves the appearance of the text display. Undoubtedly further tinkering is possible	
	Another alternative is a 4.2 interface to the 3.5 framework.
	This reduces the library by ~35% (~250 K) and pure Zinc executables by 30 - 35% (100 - 150 K)
	This may well allow an executable with a database library to run in DOS real mode
	This is likely the best bet.
