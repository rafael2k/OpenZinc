The Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 compiler objects too the identifier DM_POSITION so in all occurances it has been replaced by DM_POSITION_IMAGE.

libc.lib has been replace by a family of libraries in Visual C++ 2010 so the library clibmt.lib has been substituted.

The library ctl3d32.lib is no longer supported or needed for visual C++ 2010 so it has been eliminated

Also, in various files in the designer the section reading

// Metrowerks bug requires taking the address of the member function.
#if defined(__MWERKS__) || defined(__DECCXX) || defined(__linux__)
#	define ZIL_PROCESS_REFERENCE(x) &ZAF_HELP_EDITOR::x
#else
#	define ZIL_PROCESS_REFERENCE(x) x
#endif

has been changed to 

// Metrowerks bug requires taking the address of the member function.
#if defined(__MWERKS__) || defined(__DECCXX) || defined(__linux__) || (_MSC_VER > 1500)
#	define ZIL_PROCESS_REFERENCE(x) &ZAF_HELP_EDITOR::x
#else
#	define ZIL_PROCESS_REFERENCE(x) x
